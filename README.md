1. Write a function which takes a list of numbers and returns the length of the longest continuous stretch of a single number.  For example, on the input [1,7,7,3], the correct return is 2, because there are two 7's in a row. On the input [1,7,7,3,9,9,9,4,9], the correct return is 3, since there are three 9â€™s in a row.

2. Given a list of peoples' birth year and death year, find the year(s) in which the most people were alive at the same time. ex: [[1910, 1950], [1900, 1951], [1945, 2000]] would return [1945, 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950]
